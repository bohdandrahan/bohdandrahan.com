                        The main idea is that the only thing is forever is THE DANCE people do. The faces change
                        over
                        time,
                        but
                        the dance stays the same. <br>
                        People were dancing it for milenia and just recently you were born. Now it's your turn
                        <br>

                        eternal dance, eternal dance
